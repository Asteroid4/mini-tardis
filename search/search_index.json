If you're reading this, you've most  likely recently gotten (or are soon to get) your hands on a brand-new Model 82-4 TARDIS, congratulations! In the event that you do not have prior training operating this TARDIS model, it is highly recommended that you read this guide in full before making any attempts at flight.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>While most of this guide will still be applicable if your TARDIS is the expanded Model 82-4T, additional functionality such as inter-temporal targeting and displacement will not be covered.</p> <p>If you are currently not in possession of a Model 82-4 TARDIS,  see the Getting Started page for details on how to locate one.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>In the event that you get stuck on a new world without your trusty TARDIS,  you may have to locate a new one. Since it is definitely not possible to  construct a Model 82-4 TARDIS using only the resources found on such a world,  you will have to use unconventional means to obtain it.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/#attracting-a-tardis","title":"Attracting a TARDIS","text":"<p>One thing you are able to make use of is the tendency for trajectories of ships travelling the time vortex to intersect. By constructing a rudimentary vessel to enter the time vortex,  you stand a good chance of being picked up by a stray timeship.  Once inside, it should be trivial for any sufficiently trained individual to safely rematerialize their new TARDIS.</p> <p>Blueprints for a basic vessel capable of entering the time vortex are displayed below,  using materials most likely to be available on any new world.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/#recipes","title":"Recipes","text":"<p>Start by constructing some base components, including a Makeshift Tardis Engine, Handbrake, and about half a stack of Tardis Plating</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"getting_started/#construction","title":"Construction","text":"<p>Once you've collected these materials, you'll be able to construct your makeshift TARDIS.

For your own safety, please make sure to stay inside the dematerialization zone while your TARDIS is taking off.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Using the makeshift TARDIS will deposit it and you into a fully-fledged Model 82-4 timeship, which will be in flight at your moment of entry.
