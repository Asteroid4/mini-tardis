Instead, it requires you to use the Localization Corrector buttons to correct Error while in flight. In short, Error will make your landing location inaccurate,  potentially offsetting it by its current value in any direction. As such, you'll almost always want your Error to be zero before landing.</p> <p>While in flight, the current Error value along with the correction hud are shown in the Status app. Each vertical set of switches in the correction hud correspond to a position on the Scale Interpreter, the currently selected one being highlighted. The more of these switches are centered and thus green, the smaller your Error will be.</p> <p></p> <p>The state of the correction switches can be changed by selecting a set and using the Localization Corrector buttons, each set of buttons able to shift one of the switches.

This does however come with a few additional complexities.</p> <p>For one, the Dimensions app does not have access to all dimensions by default,  they have to be manually registered to its memory for the TARDIS to be able to travel to them at will. This can be achieved either by using the 'Add' button inside the app while already having a different dimension targeted, or by loading the app onto a floppy and interacting with it inside the dimension. (Temporary method) Once a dimension is added, clicking its star inside the app will set your destination to use that dimension.</p> <p>Additionally, to actually travel to a different dimension, you must temporarily destabilize your conduit through the  time vortex in a controlled manner and enter a \"drifting\" state. This can be achieved by unlocking your destination mid-flight, and pulling the handbrake as if trying to land.</p> <p>Upon entering a drifting state, you'll quickly hear a bell sound,  this is the TARDIS attempting to assist your uncontrolled travel. For every bell sound you hear, pull the Handbrake once. After a certain amount of repetitions, you will hear a confirmation and be automatically returned to stable flight,  now within your selected dimension, after which you'll be able to land like normal.</p> <p>The Status app helpfully provides a visual indicator for the amount of repetitions required while drifting.</p> <p></p> <p>Warning</p> <p>While in a drifting state, your TARDIS will very rapidly lose stability.
