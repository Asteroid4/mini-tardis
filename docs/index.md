Welcome to the Mini Tardis documentation. If you're reading this, you've most 
likely recently gotten your hands on a brand-new Model 82-4 TARDIS, congratulations!
In the event that you do not have prior training operating this TARDIS model,
it is highly recommended that you read this guide in full before making any attempts at flight.

!!! note

    If your TARDIS instead is a Model 82-4T, while most of this guide will still be applicable,
    additional functionality such as inter-temporal targeting and displacement will not be covered.
