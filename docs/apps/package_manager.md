# Package Manager

The Package Manager app provides utilities to install and uninstall apps between TdOS and a [Floppy Disk].

When opening this app, you may be prompted to insert a floppy if you haven't already. 
You can do this by right-clicking the floppy on the underside of the screen.

Once a floppy is inserted, the left side of the screen will represent the apps loaded onto the floppy, 
while the right side displays apps installed on your TARDIS.
Clicking on an app will highlight it and show its name, clicking a second time will move it to the other side, 
either installing or uninstalling it.

This app is installed by default on any new TARDIS, and cannot be uninstalled.

!!! tip

    Don't miss the scroll buttons on the right side of each column, 
    as these will help you browse large libraries of apps.

!!! note

    The same app cannot currently be installed twice, 
    and the TARDIS has a limit of 12 apps that can be installed at any given time.
    *These limitations may be removed in future updates.*
