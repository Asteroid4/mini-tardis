# Look and Feel

This app lets you change the background color of the TdOS UI, 
and will be expanded to support other "look and feel"-esque features in the future.

As it stands now, it provides a full color picker and keeps a history of 6 previously selected background colors.
The selected background color only applies to the current screen, any other screens can have it changed independently.

This app can be found randomly generated in dungeon chests and similar places.
