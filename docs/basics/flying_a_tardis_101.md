# Flying a TARDIS 101

The primary function of a TARDIS is, of course, travel. In order to travel from one place to another, your TARDIS
must first dematerialize, travel the time vortex, and then rematerialize at a set destination.
This page is intended to serve as a non-comprehensive guide for these operations,
and should provide a complete enough overview to safely traverse your first flight.

## Locating your destination

To select a landing location, make use of the [GPS] app and [Localization Corrector] buttons. 
A conventional console will have two opposite facing sets of these for horizontal modifications, 
plus one additional [Lateral Corrector] connected to a state switch for vertical control.

The GPS app will show you your current location in the world and selected destination.
Each corrector will nudge your destination a certain amount of blocks in one cardinal direction, 
dependent on the value your [Scale Interpreter] is set to. 

The lateral corrector functions a little differently, as instead of moving in X block increments, 
it snaps to the nearest valid landing spot in the current vertical column.
This lets you easily target caves or floating structures as your destination.
The direction it moves in is dependent on the attached state switch (the comparator-looking thing).

!!! note

    Whilst this is all possible to do during flight, 
    setting and verifying your destination beforehand is usually recommended
    to prevent potentially stressful situations and reduce energy usage from being dematerialized.

!!! tip
    
    If you have access to the [Terrain Scanner] app, you can use that to verify and fine-tune your landing location.
